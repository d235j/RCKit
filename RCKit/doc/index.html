<h1>RCKit library for Arduino</h1>
<p>
This is the Arduino RCKit 1.1 library.<p>
RCKit provides a kit of software objects that make it easy to build an <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> (Remote Control Over IP) receiver on Arduino. <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> protocol is used to carry remote control commands from a transmitter to a receiver over an IP transport such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi.<p>
As such it can be used to build Remote Controlled (RC) vehicles and devices of various kinds, along with matching transmitters. Large numbers of channels can be supported, along with a back-channel which sends data from the Receiver to the Transmitter. A compatible iPhone transmitter app is also available.<p>
The transmitter could be a handheld Wi-Fi enabled device such as an iPhone, iPad or Arduino based device. Or it could be an interactive program running on a desktop computer. The RCTx iPhone transmitter app is available on the Apple App Store. It provides a simple <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> transmitter equipped with 2 joysticks and a number of switches.<p>
The receiver (using this RCKit software) could be a remote controlled car, plane, helicopter or some other device.<p>
The <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> protocol is a 2-way protocol that defines UDP messages between the <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> transmitter and receiver. This effectively makes the transmitter a UDP client and the receiver a UDP server. Messages sent from the transmitter to the receiver include setting analog outputs, and messages from the receiver to the transmitter include receiver status messages.<p>
RCTx, RCKit and the <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> protocol offer the following advantages over conventional Remote Control: <ul>
<li>Large numbers of channels (&gt; 100) not just 5 or 6, including analog, digital, text, data etc. </li>
<li>Back channel for telemetry (voltages, signal strengths, GPS position etc) </li>
<li>Failsafe modes </li>
<li>Programmable, configurable and extensible </li>
<li>Works with a variety of types of vehicle and remote devices </li>
<li>Hackable </li>
<li>Opportunity to tightly integrate remote control and autonomous vehicle software control </li>
<li>Works with a variety of IP transports Wi-Fi (ad-hoc or infrastructure), Wired etc.</li>
</ul>

There is also a video showing how RCKit can be used with the IRrc library at <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/IRrc">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/IRrc</a> to control a 3 channel infra-red model helicopter at: <ul>

<a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a> class is a Wi-Fi <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> receiver.

By default, <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a> is configured as an Ad-Hoc Wi-Fi network with SSID of 'RCArduino' By default, the network is Open (ie no encryption) and It is configured with a static IP address of 169.254.1.100. These setting can be changed by editing RCRx.cpp in the RCKit distribution.<p>
When the <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a> object is constructed, it must be given an array of <a class="el" href="classSetter.html" title="Virtual base class for classes that receive a value, maybe transform it and then...">Setter</a> objects. When a <a class="el" href="structRCOIPv1CmdSetAnalogChannels.html" title="SetAnalogChannels command message structure.">RCOIPv1CmdSetAnalogChannels</a> is received by <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a>, The <a class="el" href="classSetter.html" title="Virtual base class for classes that receive a value, maybe transform it and then...">Setter</a> corresponding to each Channel value in the <a class="el" href="structRCOIPv1CmdSetAnalogChannels.html" title="SetAnalogChannels command message structure.">RCOIPv1CmdSetAnalogChannels</a> command will be passed to the respective <a class="el" href="classSetter.html" title="Virtual base class for classes that receive a value, maybe transform it and then...">Setter</a> in the analogOutputs array.

<dl class="user" compact><dt><b>RCTx iPhone App</b></dt><dd></dd></dl>
RCTx is an <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> compliant transmitter for iPhone available on the Apple App Store at <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/rctx/id377833472?mt=8">http://itunes.apple.com/app/rctx/id377833472?mt=8</a><p>
It presents a simulated RC transmitter with 2 joysticks and a number of switches. The left josystick sets channels 0 and 1 and the right joystick channels 2 and 3. The switches set channels 4 through 9 inclusive. The one connected to channel 4 is momentary contact. The install and configure RCTx: <ul>
<li>install the RCTx app on your iPhone. </li>
<li>Build and upload your <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a> program you your Arduino+WiShield hardware </li>
<li>Power up the Arduino </li>
<li>Turn on your iphone, go to Settings, Wi-Fi. Enable Wi-Fi </li>
<li>After about 30 seconds, you should see the RCArduino network appear as an available network on the iPhone. Tap on it. Now tap on the RCArduino network details arrow to the right of the RCArduino line. Select 'Static'. Enter an IP Address of 169.254.1.1. Enter a Subnet Mask of 255.255.0.0 </li>
<li>After about 10 seconds, the iPhone should be successfully connected to the RCArduino network. You now have an ad-hoc connection to the Arduino. The Arduino will have the address 169.254.1.100 and the iPhone wil have address 169.254.1.1 </li>
<li>Start the RCTx app on the iPhone. </li>
<li>After about 5 seconds, you should see the NO CONNECT in the bottom left corner change to show RSSI and the correct battery voltage (if the Arduino is so equipped). </li>
<li>Move the josticks and buttons. This will send <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> commands to the Arduino. <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a> in the arduino will convert them to analog output signals to drive your hardware. Have fun.</li>
