<div class="textblock"><p>This is the Arduino RCKit library.</p>
<p>RCKit provides a kit of software objects that make it easy to build an <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> (Remote Control Over IP) receiver on Arduino. <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> protocol is used to carry remote control commands from a transmitter to a receiver over an IP transport such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>As such it can be used to build Remote Controlled (RC) vehicles and devices of various kinds, along with matching transmitters. Large numbers of channels can be supported, along with a back-channel which sends data from the Receiver to the Transmitter. A compatible iPhone transmitter app is also available.</p>
<p>The transmitter could be a handheld Wi-Fi enabled device such as an iPhone, iPad or Arduino based device. Or it could be an interactive program running on a desktop computer. The RCTx iPhone transmitter app is available on the Apple App Store. It provides a simple <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> transmitter equipped with 2 joysticks and a number of switches.</p>
<p>The receiver (using this RCKit software) could be a remote controlled car, plane, helicopter or some other device.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> protocol is a 2-way protocol that defines UDP messages between the <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> transmitter and receiver. This effectively makes the transmitter a UDP client and the receiver a UDP server. Messages sent from the transmitter to the receiver include setting analog outputs, and messages from the receiver to the transmitter include receiver status messages.</p>
<p>RCTx, RCKit and the <a class="el" href="classRCOIP.html" title="This section describes the RCOIP (Remote Control Over IP) protocol.">RCOIP</a> protocol offer the following advantages over conventional Remote Control: </p>
<ul>
<li>Large numbers of channels (&gt; 100) not just 5 or 6, including analog, digital, text, data etc. </li>
<li>Back channel for telemetry (voltages, signal strengths, GPS position etc) </li>
<li>Failsafe modes </li>
<li>Programmable, configurable and extensible </li>
<li>Works with a variety of types of vehicle and remote devices </li>
<li>Hackable </li>
<li>Opportunity to tightly integrate remote control and autonomous vehicle software control </li>
<li>Works with a variety of IP transports Wi-Fi (ad-hoc or infrastructure), Wired etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can use it with the <a class="el" href="classWiShieldTransceiver.html" title="Defines a WiSHield RCOIP Transceiver.">WiShieldTransceiver</a> object to use WiFi to communicate directly to a WiShield equipped <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a> receiver.

<p>RCTx presents a simulated RC transmitter with 2 joysticks and a number of switches. The left josystick sets channels 0 and 1 and the right joystick channels 2 and 3. The switches set channels 4 through 9 inclusive. The one connected to channel 4 is momentary contact.</p>
<p>To install and configure RCTx to work with a WiShield equipped <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a>: </p>

</ul>
<p>These prerequisites must be installed in the libraries directory of your Arduino devlopment environment, even if you are not going to use them with <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a>, otherwise the <a class="el" href="classRCRx.html" title="Remote Control Receiver module for RCOIP protocol on Arduino.">RCRx</a> will not build.</p>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>Installation</b></dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>Install in the usual way: unzip the distribution zip file to the libraries sub-folder of your Arduino IDE sketchbook.</p>
<dl class="user"><dt><b>WiShield Library Configuration</b></dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>Requires the Asynclabs WiShield library to be installed, even if you are not using the <a class="el" href="classWiShieldTransceiver.html" title="Defines a WiSHield RCOIP Transceiver.">WiShieldTransceiver</a>. See <a href="http://asynclabs.com/wiki/index.php?title=WiShield_library">http://asynclabs.com/wiki/index.php?title=WiShield_library</a> Install the WiShield library in the libraries directory of your arduino IDE installation, then follow the configuration steps below:</p>
<p>Support of RSSI (receiver signal strength indicator) requires mods to WiShield library g2100.c as per <a href="http://asynclabs.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=385&start=0.">http://asynclabs.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=10&amp;t=385&amp;start=0.</a> You dont have to add this but its a good feature. It is included in the prebuilt WiShield library mentioned below.</p>
<p>Correct operation of the WiShield requires you to set the jumper on the WiShield to INT0 or DIG8 to select the arduino pin to use for WiShield interrupts, and also to make sure it agrees with the settings of USE_DIG0_INTR or USE_DIG8_INTR in spi.h in the WiShield library (which defaults to using Arduino digital pin 2, and which means setting the WiShield jumper to INT0 setting). Yes, the naming conventions are inconsistent :-(. In summary: </p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">  WiShield jumper   spi.h          Arduino
       INT0        USE_DIG0_INTR  Digital pin 2
       D8          USE_DIG8_INTR  Digital pin 8
</pre></div><p>For YellowJacket (which has no jumper), leave it as USE_DIG0_INTR.</p>
<p>In order for WiShield library to support UDP (as needed by this module), you MUST set UIP_CONF_UDP to 1 in uip-conf.h. This is an unfortunate but necessary requirement, otherwise UDP support will not be compiled into the WiShield library. Further, you must edit apps-conf.h and make sure the only APP_* defined is APP_UDPAPP. Failure to do this will cause compile errors.</p>
<p>A modified version of the WiShield library already modified and configured for use with RCKit (including RSSI support) is available at <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/WiShield-v1.3.0-0-mikem-RCKit.zip">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/WiShield-v1.3.0-0-mikem-RCKit.zip</a></p>
<p>WiShield will work with Arduino Mega, but with difficulty. The problem is that with the Mega, the SPI pins that are required for interface with WiShield come out on different pins to the smaller form factor arduinos like Diecimila and Duemilanove. So, to make the Mega work with the WiShield, you have to reroute the SPI pin to different Arduino pins, as per <a href="http://asynclabs.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=19&hilit=mega&start=10">http://asynclabs.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=19&amp;hilit=mega&amp;start=10</a></p>
<p>By default, <a class="el" href="classWiShieldTransceiver.html" title="Defines a WiSHield RCOIP Transceiver.">WiShieldTransceiver</a> is configured as an Ad-Hoc Wi-Fi network with SSID of 'RCArduino' By default, the network is Open (ie no encryption) and It is configured with a static IP address of 169.254.1.100. These setting can be changed by editing WiShieldTransceiver.cpp in the RCKit distribution.</p>
